This is a guideline containing some best practices for how to approach new ideas and their successful implementation.

## 1. The idea

Describe the idea in one or two (!) sentences.

## 2. Purpose

Where did the idea come from? Is there concerete demand or are the benefits speculative? Is it really needed and why exactly?
The purpose is what you will always come back to during the entire process from start to finish.
Thinking about this thoroughly will effect everything else and help us to avoid this:

;)

## 3. Timeframe

Is it worth spending multiple weeks on this or does it only make sense if it can be done in a week?
Don't estimate how long it WILL take. Estimate how long it SHOULD take, based on the benefit it provides.
The maximum timeframe is 6 weeks!

## 4. Evaluation

You can stop here. Now it's time to share opinions and collaborate on evaluating the idea.
Maybe it's awesome and desperatley needed. But maybe you overlooked something, rendering the idea invalid.
If there's consent that the idea is worth pursuing, move on to the next step.

## 5. Minimum Viable Product

You've set a timeframe of 2 weeks? What if you had only 2 days?
What's the most simple implementation that still serves the purpose?
Write an unordered list of tasks/components and try to group them into "absolutely essential", "a pitty not to have" and "nice to have".
Keep the purpose in mind.

## 6. Rabbit holes

Most of the necessary work often lies "below the surface". It needs to be discovered.
Start exploring the involved parts practically. Write some code. Draw some mockups. Write the first sentence for a docs page.
Pay special attention to things that might easily become very time consuming.
If you feel like going down a rabbit hole, browsing docs, fiddling around with code examples, stop.
Write down what you found and didn't think of before.

## 7. Implementation

Now the clock starts ticking. Your timeframe starts.
Constantly update the list with new tasks you discover and always try to group things into components.
Usually the more tasks you have discovered, the closer you are to the finish line.
Don't get scared by a growing list. Appreciate it.
Finish the MVP first. Once your done with that, you can't lose anymore and the timeframe won't stress you.
Finish component after component and try to not jump between them.
Keep the purpose in mind and focus on the essential parts first.
At the end of the timeframe, deploy. You're done. No matter what.

## 8. Celebration

Lean back and enjoy the result. Write a short post, tweet it. Write or update a docs page.
Take a look at the code again. Add another comment here and there. Feel good about your work.
